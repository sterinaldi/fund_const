# Probability distribution for the gravitational constant G
Inference of the gravitational constant probability G using the experiments listed in [Tisinga et al. (2021)](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.93.025010).

This code implements the two inferences described in Middleton et al (in preparation). To run it, simply use the command `source run_inference.sh`.
